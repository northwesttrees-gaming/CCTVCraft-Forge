# CCTV Craft
Whether you want to spy on your friend's house on a server, or you want to keep an eye on your village, CCTV Craft will provide you the tools to watch whatever you want anywhere you want. We have used MCreator to make this complex mod from the ground up. The mod is maintained by NorthWestTrees Gaming. Currently, we have limited features but we plan to add more content and release stable builds as the development goes on.

## 🧪 BETA Releases
Keep in mind that the mod is still in beta, I push out fixes when I find them as fast as I can.  
The modification is pretty large in size so it takes a bit of time to locate issues in the script.  
If you find a issue please report the issue page on this GitHub so I can try to find a solution to the issue.

Newer versions do not require any dependecies but for 1.15.2 and 1.14.4 you may need an API I made.

- If you are using the modification for 1.14.4 you will need to use MMP UUID 1.2.0 for "General Use"  
- If you are using the modification for 1.15.2 you will need to use MMP UUID 1.3.0 for "General Use"
