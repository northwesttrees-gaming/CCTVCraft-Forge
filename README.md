# CCTV Craft
Whether you want to spy on your friend's house on a server, or you want to keep an eye on your village, CCTV Craft will provide you the tools to watch whatever you want anywhere you want. We have used MCreator to make this complex mod from the ground up. The mod is maintained by NorthWestTrees Gaming. Currently, we have limited features but we plan to add more content and release stable builds as the development goes on.

## Dependencies
- If you are using mod version for 1.14.4 or 1.15.2 you will require MMP UUID API  
- If you are using the modification for 1.14.4 you will need to use MMP UUID 1.2.0 for "General Use"  
- If you are using the modification for 1.15.2 you will need to use MMP UUID 1.3.0 for "General Use"  

## Minecraft Support for 1.x.x
Simply put newer versions will be supported for sure, but anything older is not possible with MCreator and only newer versions will get new features.

## Planned Features
- Proximity Scanner
- Alarm & Alarm System
- Tracking System
- Turrets
- Explosives and Metal Detectors
- Drones
- Screwdriver Item
- First Aid Kits & Fabric
